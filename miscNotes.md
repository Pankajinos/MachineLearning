### Regression models are used for continious models 
- so using accuracy_score(y_predict, y_test) isn't meaningfull as it is impossible to match continious values exactly 
- So using other parameters like MSE (mean squre error)-> varience, MAE (mean absolute error), RMSE-> st_dev
- R**2 Coefficient of determination
